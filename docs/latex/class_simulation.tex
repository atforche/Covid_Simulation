The \mbox{\hyperlink{class_simulation}{Simulation}} class The Abstract \mbox{\hyperlink{class_simulation}{Simulation}} class from which all other simulations will be derived. Provides a common interface through which each simulation can be executed in the same screen space with the same driver.

execute Function to execute a single timestep in the simulation. Function should be called in a loop by the driver, not called within the class. Needs to be overridden by derived classes 

test Function to test each simulation type. Exact purpose of function can change depending on what needs to be tested. Needs to be overridden by derived classes 

Implemented in \mbox{\hyperlink{class_simple_simulation_a8fa34536fb673562dccd7e255d32bc71}{Simple\+Simulation}}.
